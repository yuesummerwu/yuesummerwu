<h3 align="left">The Academic Me 🕵️‍♀️ </h3> 

I received my K-12 education in China. Before attending Zhengzhou Foreign Language School for high school, I studied at a public school in my hometown. While my city’s educational resources weren’t considered top-tier, I always felt deeply grateful for my educational experiences. I recognize the many privileges I had, which have profoundly shaped my perspective on education and equity.

I later attended New York University (NYU) for my undergraduate studies, where I double-majored in Education Studies and Applied Psychology. My time at NYU gave me a strong foundation in theoretical knowledge about education and a deeper understanding of the relationship between psychological constructs and learning. It was also where I was introduced to academic research, which empowered me to use data and visualizations to explore topics in education and psychology, as well as inform policymaking.

Driven by my passion for combining data science with education to create meaningful change, I joined the Learning Analytics program at Teachers College, Columbia University. There, I gained extensive hands-on experience in data processing, engineering, management, and model building, further preparing me to tackle challenges at the intersection of education and data science. 

Equity is at the core of my beliefs. I see it as not just an ideal but a shared obligation and responsibility for everyone. While achieving true equity requires collective efforts, I believe researchers hold a unique position of influence in raising awareness and driving change. Through data, research, and evidence-based insights, we can spotlight disparities, amplify underrepresented voices, and inspire action toward a more equitable future.

<h3 align="left">Me on Github 👩‍💻</h3>

I am deeply fascinated by the concept of open data science GitHub has been an invaluable resource for me, and I aspire to contribute back by sharing my learning materials and code.Data cleaning and engineering are some of the most intensive yet rewarding parts of data science, and I’ve learned so much from exploring the work of others. While my code is still at a beginner level, I’m excited to share it as a way to connect with experts, gain hands-on experience, and encourage other novices to take their first step into the field.

In short, GitHub is where I learn, grow, and contribute to the open data science community. It is also a platform to track my progress and document my learning journey. 🌟
